<h1>JACK requires extra permissions</h1>
<p>
	JACK and other Audio programs such as Ardour (even running with the ALSA backend),
	require permissions that most desktops do not provide by default. They require the
	ability to raise their priority level to prevent such things as mouse movements or
	other applications heavy CPU use from causing skips, pops or other noises in the audio
	signal.
</p>
<p>
	These programs also require permission to lock memory they use from being swapped out
	as that could cause a recording gap in that "perfect take".
</p>
<p>
	The installation script that is included in most JACK packages tries to set this at
	install time but many modern installers skip this step. If your installer has skipped
	this step, Studio Controls will warn you of this problem. This is generally a one time fix
	but each user account will need to do this fix. Studio Controls will show this at the top
	of it's window:

<p>To correct this problem, click on the button that says <em>Fix Real Time Permissions</em>.
Then reboot the system for these settings to take effect. Before systemd, only a logout and 
login was required but most desktop environments do not make sure systemd actually logs them
all the way out at the time of writing.</p>
