<h1>Jack Session Management</h1>
<p>
	When a project uses more than one JACK application, a session manager will help by
	automatically starting all applications needed for a project and making any
	connections in JACK needed as well.
</p>

<p>
	In order for the session manager to do it's job, it needs a "clean" system with no
	jack connections made. However, many applications auto connect on startup to the system
	inputs and outputs 1 and 2. Other applications will make more connections on
	startup. JACK provides a <strong>Self Connect Mode</strong> that can prevent an
	application from making these connections.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Connect Mode</strong> has five modes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Don't restrict self connect requests</strong> is the default mode for JACK.
	JACK allows any client to make any connections.</li>
	<li><strong>Fail self connect requests to external ports only</strong> will allow a client
	to connect it's own ports only to ports that are not hardware but will fail to connect
	to hardware ports. A fail means the application is aware the connection was not made.</li>
	<li><strong>Ignore self connect requests to external ports only</strong> will
	silently ignore requests for an application to connect its own port to hardware port.</li>
	<li><strong>Fail all self connect requests</strong> will not allow a JACK client
	to connect any of it's own ports and will respond with a fail.</li>
	<li><strong>Ignore all self connect requests</strong> will silently ignore a JACK
	clients request to connect it's own ports.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	There are also three convenience buttons to start session manager controls. There have
	been a number of session managers for Linux but the one that seems to have remained
	is NSM. The original <em>Non Session Manger</em> was a part of the Non group of applications, but
	because of licensing issues was not packaged for many distributions. Development also
	slowed down and bugs were not being fixed. However, more applications are "NSM ready"
	than any other session manager. <em>Raysession</em> was started for this reason as a reimagined
	NSM controller followed by the <em>New Session Manager</em> which was Non Session Manger ported
	from NTK to FLTK and with bugs fixed and some enhancement. Then <em>Agordejo</em> was developed
	as a modern graphic interface to go with New Session Manager.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Agordejo</strong> sets itself as the main graphic user interface to the
	<strong>New Session Manager</strong>. It was developed by the same development team as
	the New Session Manager.</li>
	<li><strong>RaySession</strong> is another session manager that uses the same interface
	as New Session Manager.</li>
	<li><strong>New Session Manager</strong> will start the legacy NSM GUI ported to FLTK.</li>
</ul>
